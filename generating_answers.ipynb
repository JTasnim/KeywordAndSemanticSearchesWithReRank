    "\n",
    "AI is nascent, and many technologies \\\n",

    "deep learning are maturing — and \\\n",

    "changing technology is more \\\n",
    "important in AI than fields that \\\n",

    "challenging to find a suitable \\\n",
    "project, estimate the project’s \\\n",

    "While searching for a job in AI can \\\n",

    "\n",
    "More papers have been published on AI \\\n",

    "it’s critical to \\\n",
    "prioritize topic selection. I believe the \\\n",
    "most important topics \\\n",
    "for a technical career in machine learning are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Foundational machine learning skills. For \\\n",
    "example, it’s important \\\n",
    "to understand models such as linear \\\n",
    "regression, logistic regression, \\\n",
    "neural networks, decision trees, clustering, \\\n",
    "and anomaly detection. \\\n",
    "Beyond specific models, it’s even more \\\n",
    "important to understand the \\\n",
    "core concepts behind how and why machine \\\n",
    "learning works, such as \\\n",
    "bias/variance, cost functions, regularization, \\\n",
    "optimization algorithms, \\\n",
    "and error analysis.\n",
    "Deep learning. This has become such a large \\\n",
    "fraction of machine \\\n",
    "learning that it’s hard to excel in the \\\n",
    "field without some understanding \\\n",
    "of it! It’s valuable to know the basics of \\\n",
    "neural networks, practical \\\n",
    "skills for making them work (such as \\\n",
    "hyperparameter tuning), \\\n",
    "convolutional networks, sequence models, \\\n",
    "and transformers.\n",
    "Math relevant to machine learning. Key \\\n",
    "areas include linear \\\n",
    "algebra (vectors, matrices, and various \\\n",
    "manipulations of them) \\\n",
    "as well as probability and statistics \\\n",
    "(including discrete and \\\n",
    "continuous probability, standard probability \\\n",
    "distributions, \\\n",
    "basic rules such as independence and Bayes \\\n",
    "rule, and hypothesis \\\n",
    "testing). In addition, exploratory data \\\n",
    "analysis (EDA) — using \\\n",
    "visualizations and other methods to \\\n",
    "systematically explore a \\\n",

    "found EDA particularly \\\n",
    "useful in data-centric AI development, \\\n",
    "where analyzing errors \\\n",

    "calculus will also help. \\\n",
    "In a previous letter, I described how \\\n",
    "the math \\\n",
    "needed to do machine learning well has \\\n",
    "been changing. For \\\n",
    "instance, although some tasks require \\\n",

    "possible to invent and implement \\\n",
    "new neural network architectures \\\n",

    "Software development. While you can \\\n",

    "learning modeling skills, \\\n",
    "your job opportunities will increase if \\\n",
    "you can also write \\\n",
    "good software to implement complex AI \\\n",
    "systems. These skills \\\n",

    "relate to machine learning, such as \\\n",
    "data frames), \\\n",
    "algorithms (including those related to \\\n",

    "or PyTorch, and scikit-learn.\\\n",
    "This is a lot to learn! Even after you \\\n",
    "master everything in this list, I hope you’ll \\\n",

    "But when the goal is deep understanding, \\\n",
    "reading disjointed \n",

    "a coherent and \n",

    "Keep reading and talking to people. I come \\\n",

      "Focus on an application area. Many researchers are trying to advance basic AI technology — say, by inventing the next generation of transformers or further scaling up language models — so, while this is an exciting direction, it is hard. But the variety of applications to which machine learning has not yet been applied is vast! I’m fortunate to have been able to apply neural networks to everything from autonomous helicopter flight to online advertising, partly because I jumped in when relatively few people were working on those applications. If your company or school cares about a particular application, explore the possibilities for machine learning. That can give you a first look at a potentially creative application — one where you can do unique work — that no one else has done yet.\n",
      "Develop a side hustle. Even if you have a full-time job, a fun project that may or may not develop into something bigger can stir the creative juices and strengthen bonds with collaborators. When I was a full-time professor, working on online education wasn’t part of my “job” (which was doing research and teaching classes). It was a fun hobby that I often worked on out of passion for education. My early experiences recording videos at home helped me later in working on online education in a more substantive way. Silicon Valley abounds with stories of startups that started as side projects. So long as it doesn’t create a conflict with your employer, these projects can be a stepping stone to something significant.\n",
